This is a fork of the Spigot plugin with the equivalent name, for which further development was discontinued. FreeRPG is a spigot 1.15+ plugin that adds an RPG skill system to Minecraft. Inspired by Mcmmo, the
goal is to offer a free Mcmmo alternative. Each skill has a skill tree, with an additional global
skill tree. The skill trees can be accessed with a very simplistic, Hypixel inspired GUI.

To get started playing, type ``/frpg``. This will bring up the GUI seen in the screenshot above.
Clicking on any of the icons will take you to that skill's skill tree. Hovering over any of the
icons or clicking on them will tell you more about the perk as shown in the screenshot below.

Earning experience is straightforward, mine blocks to get mining experience, cut trees to get woodcutting
experience, etc.

By the default configuration, each level you finish, will gain **1 passive token** which can be
invested in the passive skills represented by the dyes on the left. Every 100 levels, you will
gain **1 skill token** which can be invested in the skills represented by the terracotta skill tree.
Every 1000 levels, you will gain **1 global token** that can be used in the global skill tree.
Please check the wiki, for further information on how to configure FreeRPG to your needs.

FreeRPG provides 10 abilities to the player which can be leveled.
