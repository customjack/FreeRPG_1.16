# This file is intended to be large and allow the ability to change and configure experience drops
#
# Some experience drops are located in perkConfig.yml
#
# ------------------------------------
# CUSTOM BLOCK EXPERIENCE INFORMATION:
# ------------------------------------
#
# 1) ***REQUIRED*** MATERIAL: The name of the block.
#    [TAGS] block
#    [EXAMPLE] block: PINK_BED

#            If a material is NOT recognized, it will simply not be considered (ex. NETHERITE_SCRAP in MC v1.15 will be ignored)
# 2) BREAK EXPERIENCE: The amount of the item dropped.
#    [TAGS] breakExp
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] 0
#    [EXAMPLE] breakExp: 100
#    [NOTES] Must be an integer.
# 3) NATURAL REQUIREMENT: whether or not the block must be natural to drop exp
#    [TAGS] natural, isNatural
#    [DEFAULT VALUE] false
#    [EXAMPLE] natural: false
#    [NOTES] Value must be "true" or "false." All blocks marked with "natural" are tracked in a file.
