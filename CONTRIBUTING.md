## Balancing

Want to contribute balancing changes to the default config? Great, please open an issue and let us
know about your changes. We will be happy to integrate them.

## Translation

You want to translate FreeRPG to a different language? Great, clone this repository or download the
[languages.yml](https://github.com/AdvancedWipe/Minecraft_FreeRPG_1.16/blob/master/src/main/resources/languages.yml)
file. Open it using a texteditor or an IDE. Start by coping for example the english translation (

for the marked section of a file that needs to be copied for a full translation) to the bottom of
the file. Replace `enUS:` by your country and start translating the values of the key. A key value
pair is defined by `variableName: Variable Name` for example `languageName: English`, `languageName`
is the variable name and `English` is the translation. In other words you always need to replace the
words next to the variable name with your translation.

## Adding Blocks and Entities from newer Minecraft versions to FreeRPG

Most new blocks, items and entities can be simply added by adding them to the different
configuration files. Afterwards some changes need to be done to the source code to actually apply
some of these changes. Check out these two
commits ([2455c8c](https://github.com/AdvancedWipe/Minecraft_FreeRPG_1.16/commit/2455c8c45134a0cd2392e096fd17ac357ee8c35c)
, [21cda30](https://github.com/AdvancedWipe/Minecraft_FreeRPG_1.16/commit/21cda30e69d3b567a295c2ba9b07098de1dc0540))
to get a rough understanding where and how to add them.

## Source code

Want to contribute changes to the source code? Set up your development environment as described in
the [spigot wiki](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-plugin-development/). Please make sure your
changes are following .editorconfig style, let your IDE format your changes to ensure that. Open a
pull request with your changes, and we will happily integrate them.
